# RTS Engine using MonoGame
We are creating a RTS Game Engine using MonoGame framework. It also uses a wrapped version of ImGui for the debug purposes.
For this project to work we need to install .NET 6 SDK and if by any chance something won't work, please install the MonoGame Templates:
```
dotnet new --install MonoGame.Templates.CSharp
```
If anyone needs to understand the code that's in the solution, please refer to [this](https://monogame.net/articles/getting_started/3_understanding_the_code.html) official documentation.

This project also includes the wrapped version of ImGui for the debug purposes. I added the package specifically for the MonoGame framework that uses the ImGuiNet library.
